# Reune Source Notes

This README is scoped to the `src/` directory and intentionally contains **no product behavior, feature lists, or design system details**.

**Canonical documentation** lives in the root [`README.md`](../README.md), which is the single source of truth for:
- Product behavior and rules.
- Feature lists.
- Design system and branding.

## Source Directory Focus

Use this document for implementation-specific notes about the `src/` tree if needed in the future (e.g., component architecture, local conventions). For now, refer to the root README for all product and design details.
